My first website coded from scratch using the knowlege gathered from the Odin Project's HTML and CSS lessons.
If I had to give myself a grade on it, I'd give myself an 85%. I could have made it a bit closer to perfect, but I'm happy with
what I accomplished in the short amount of time I worked on it.
